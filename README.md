Hanafuda game
=============

Hanafuda (or "flower cards") are playing cards originating from Japan that can be played in a variety of games.
The game implements the rules of *koi-koi*, one of the most famous games using these cards.

### Project's status

The project is still in early development phase.

During the first phase of the project, we develop a functional core that implements all the functionalities offered by the game and enforces strict rules for playing cards.
The second phase of the project consists in developping a graphical interface using the MVC model, in order to make the game playable in the Java Virtual Machine.
